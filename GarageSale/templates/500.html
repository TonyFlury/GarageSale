    <h2>Internal Error</h2>

    Sorry - but despite our best efforts, something has gone wrong and we weren't able to fix it.
        <br>
    Our team knows that this error occurred and we will look into this - in the mean time it can help us if you :
        <ul>
           <li>email to <a href="mailto:BranthamGarageSale@gmail.com">BranthamGarageSale@gmail.com</a> and tell us as much
               as you can about what you were trying to do.</li>
            <li>Don't try to repeat what you did when the failure happens - the chances are that the same failure will
                happen again, and we will have two sets of bad data, not one.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
