1) Make sure all changed files are committed and pushed.
    Ensure this includes :
        Migration files
        js and css
        static images
        python files


2) Open a bash console on Pythonanywhere

        cd BranthamGarageSale
        git pull origin master

        if js, css or static images have been changed :
            python manage.py collectstatic

        If changes involed models field
            python manage.py migrate

4) Confirm settings.py has the DEBUG=FALSE. Double check settings.py has nothing commented out that is critical :
    Email, Database, key middleware
    If changes are needed reflect those changes into the development branch in a easier to configure way.
    #TODO - work out how to do this without changing settings.py

5) On python anywhere Dashboard
        If changes involed models fields or any python file (including settings)
        Restart Server.

6) in a Separate Browser open the admin screen and confirm that the database is up and correct.

# TODO - find a way to have a upgrade type switch -so the website will show a simple page until ready.
